    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing the groups defined by the decision tree model.
        columns:
        - `segment_id`: The ID of the segment, for grouping.

    -------
    Figure
        A bar chart showing each segment with its corresponding avg score, x-axis represents
        the feature segments (segment_name), and y-axis shows the score.
